2048

*Disclaimer: I created this back in college, since then KineticJS (framework used to help create this game) has been abandoned and is no longer maintained.  I also checked the code in the JavaScript file... it's speghetti-ish to say the least.  I can assure anyone who looks at that file that I write much cleaner code now, maybe at some point I will rewrite this.*

Original README:
I re-coded 2048 with KineticJS just for fun, my intent was for this to be nearly identical to the famous 2048 app.

The reason why I first decided to do this was because the original 2048 was too slow for me.
I played it way too much (no seriously I lost my life to that game for a little) and I kept on 
wishing that it would be faster, and eventually my geeky self decided to go and recode it from 
scratch.  I never looked at the original source code, I coded it with my method of choice as an
HTML5 compliant front end game.  I am pleased to say I really enjoyed coding this and I love the 
final product, the logic for combining tiles was extremely tricky!
